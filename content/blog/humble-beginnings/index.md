description: How it all started...

Well I really don't remember how it all began. 

What I do remember is my first drumkit. 
Let's ask Chatgpt for an engaging introduction...

>Imagine this: The year is 1999 (yes, for real), and tucked away in a corner of my bedroom sits a gleaming treasure - my    very first drumkit. I can still feel the rush of excitement as I ran my fingers over those pristine cymbals and taut drumheads for the first time.

## Reality check

That's not really how I remember it. I remember learning to play it was hard as hell. Sure I got down the basics and loved playing that basic rock beat all day long every day. Driving my family members crazy in the process.

`Can't u play something else?`

Well, No.
